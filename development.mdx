This guide covers the basics of interacting with the Vern API to programmatically manage profiles and trigger runs.

## Obtaining API Keys

To interact with the Vern API, you need an API key.

1.  Log in to your Vern account.
2.  Navigate to the API Keys section in the Vern UI (`https://vern.so/api-keys`).
3.  Generate a new API key. Treat this key like a password; keep it secure and do not expose it in client-side code.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_VERN_API_KEY` with the key you obtained.

## Making API Requests

The Vern API is a standard REST API that uses JSON for request and response bodies.

Here's an example using `curl` to list your profiles:

```bash
curl https://api.vern.so/v1/profiles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY"
```

Refer to the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for examples of creating profiles and runs.

## API Reference

For detailed information on all available endpoints, parameters, and response formats, please consult the full [API Reference](/api-reference). (Note: You'll need to create this page or link to your OpenAPI spec).

## Rate Limits

(Add information about API rate limits here if applicable. e.g., The Vern API is subject to rate limits. Please refer to the API Reference for details on current limits.)

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. Common codes include:

- `200 OK`: Request successful.
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key.
- `403 Forbidden`: API key does not have permission.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on Vern's side.

Error responses will typically include a JSON body with more details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The provided task_id does not exist."
  }
}
```

Always check the response body for specific error messages when debugging.
