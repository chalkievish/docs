This guide covers the basics of interacting with Vern to programmatically trigger browser automation tasks.

## Obtaining API Keys

To interact with Vern, you need an API key.

1.  Log in to your Vern account.
2.  Navigate to the API Keys section in the Vern UI (`https://vern.so/api-keys`).
3.  Generate a new API key. Treat this key like a password; keep it secure and do not expose it in client-side code.

## Using the Vern SDK

We recommend using our TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for the easiest integration.

### Installation

```bash
npm install vern
```

### Initialization

```typescript
import Vern from "vern";

const vern = Vern({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
```

### Running Tasks

```typescript
// Call a task directly
const run = await vern.getCarDetails({ registration: "YLG19A" });

// Or use the explicit createRun method
const run = await vern.createRun({
  taskId: "getCarDetails",
  inputs: { registration: "YLG19A" },
});
```

## Using the REST API Directly

Alternatively, you can use the REST API directly.

### Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_VERN_API_KEY` with the key you obtained.

### Making API Requests

The Vern API is a standard REST API that uses JSON for request and response bodies.

Here's an example of creating a run:

```bash
curl -X POST https://vern.so/api/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "getCarDetails",
    "inputs": {
      "registration": "YLG19A"
    }
  }'
```

Refer to the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for more examples.

## API Reference

For detailed information on all available endpoints, parameters, and response formats, please consult the full [API Reference](/api-reference).

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. Common codes include:

- `200 OK`: Request successful.
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key.
- `403 Forbidden`: API key does not have permission.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on Vern's side.

Error responses will typically include a JSON body with more details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The provided taskId does not exist."
  }
}
```

Always check the response body for specific error messages when debugging.
