Welcome to Vern! Vern helps you connect different software applications and automate workflows between them. To get started, it's helpful to understand four key concepts:

    Represent specific configurations or user authentications for an
    integration, created via the API using an Integration ID.

  <Card title="Runs" icon="play" href="/essentials/runs">
    Execute a specific Task, potentially using a Linked Profile for context or
    authentication. Trigger runs via the API using a Task ID.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Fits Together

1.  You first create an **Integration** for each application you want Vern to connect with (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, Boracle ERP) in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/integrations).
2.  Within an Integration, you define **Tasks** that Vern can perform (e.g., "Create Invoice", "Send Notification", "Add Inventory Item") in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/tasks).
3.  When a specific user or configuration needs to use an Integration, you create a **Linked Profile** via the API, associating it with the relevant **Integration ID**. This profile securely stores credentials or settings.
4.  Finally, you trigger a **Run** via the API using the **Task ID** for the action you want to perform. You can optionally provide a **Profile ID** if the task needs specific user context or credentials stored in a Linked Profile.
