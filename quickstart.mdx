This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with Vern.

## 1. Create an Integration in the UI

Integrations represent the connection between Vern and an external application.

1.  Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://vern.so/integrations) in the Vern dashboard.
2.  Click "New Integration" and choose the application you want to connect. For this example, let's imagine connecting to a fictional ERP system called "Boracle ERP".
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate and configure the Boracle ERP integration.
4.  Once created, note down the **Integration ID** displayed for your new integration. You'll need it later.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    className="shadow-lg"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
    src="https://www.tella.tv/video/cm97z0lbw000m0bjj3z8q5v4n/embed?b=0&title=0&a=1&loop=1&autoPlay=true&t=0&muted=1&wt=0"
    allowFullScreen={true}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>
## 2. Create a Task in the UI

Tasks define the specific actions Vern can perform within an integration.

1.  Navigate to the [Tasks page](https://vern.so/tasks) in the Vern dashboard.
2.  Click "New Task" and select the Integration you just created (Boracle ERP).
3.  Define the task. For our example, let's create a task called "Add Inventory Item". Configure the necessary inputs (e.g., item name, quantity, price) and how Vern should interact with Boracle ERP's API to add the item.
4.  Once created, note down the **Task ID** displayed for your new task.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    className="shadow-lg"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
    src="https://www.tella.tv/video/cm9831o4j00000bih6mv481m2/embed?b=0&title=0&a=1&loop=1&autoPlay=true&t=0&muted=1&wt=0"
    allowFullScreen={true}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>

## 3. (Optional) Create a Linked Profile in the UI

Linked Profiles store specific user credentials or configurations needed to execute tasks. If a task needs to act on behalf of a specific user (like our "Add Inventory Item" example which needs a Boracle ERP user's credentials), you'll create a Linked Profile.

1.  Navigate to the [Profiles page](https://vern.so/profiles) in the Vern dashboard.
2.  Click "New Profile" and select the Integration you created earlier (Boracle ERP).
3.  Give the profile an email (only used as an identifier, we don't send them anything).
4.  Once created, note down the **Profile ID**.
5.  Copy the **Magic Link** provided after profile creation.
6.  Send this Magic Link to the end-user. They can use this link (which directs to `https://vern.so/profiles/[PROFILE_ID]`) to authenticate and provide their credentials for the Boracle ERP integration.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    className="shadow-lg"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
    src="https://www.tella.tv/video/cm97y8g9c000g0bl2bqibh9ns/embed?b=0&title=0&a=1&loop=1&autoPlay=true&t=0&muted=1&wt=0"
    allowFullScreen={true}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>

<Note>
  You only need to create a Linked Profile if the Task requires specific user
  credentials or configurations. Some tasks might operate at an integration
  level without needing a specific user profile.
</Note>

## 4. Create a Run via API

Runs execute a specific task, optionally using a Linked Profile.

Finally, let's trigger a run of the "Add Inventory Item" task.
You'll need your Vern API key and the **Task ID** from Step 2. If the task requires user-specific actions (like ours), you'll also need the **Profile ID** from Step 3.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vern.so/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_id": "YOUR_ADD_ITEM_TASK_ID",
    "profile_id": "USER_JOHN_DOE_PROFILE_ID", // Include this line only if using a Profile from Step 3
    "inputs": {
      "item_name": "Flux Capacitor",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 150000
      // ... other inputs defined for the task
    }
  }'
```

Replace the placeholder IDs and API key. If using a profile, include the `"profile_id"` line and its value. This request tells Vern to execute the "Add Inventory Item" task, using the provided inputs. If a profile ID is included, it uses the credentials stored in that Linked Profile.

Vern will execute the task asynchronously. The API response will contain a **Run ID** which you can use to check the status and result of the run later.

## Next Steps

You've successfully connected an application, defined a task, linked a user profile, and executed a run!

Explore the documentation further to learn about:

- Handling different authentication methods for integrations.
- More complex task definitions.
- Polling for run results or using webhooks.
- Managing multiple profiles and integrations.
