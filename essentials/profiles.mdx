<Note type="warning">
  The concept of Linked Profiles has been deprecated in the latest version of
  Vern.
</Note>

Vern now focuses on browser automation using our Tasks system, which doesn't require separate profile management. Please refer to the [Tasks](/essentials/tasks) documentation for information on how to create and manage browser automation tasks.

For a quick start guide on using Vern, see the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart).
