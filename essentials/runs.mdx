Runs represent a specific execution instance of a [Task](/essentials/tasks). When you want Vern to perform an action defined by a Task, you create a Run.

## Purpose of Runs

- **Task Execution:** Trigger the actual performance of a defined Task.
- **Input Provision:** Provide the specific data (inputs) required by the Task for this particular execution.
- **Tracking:** Each Run represents a traceable instance of a workflow execution, allowing you to monitor its status and results.

## Creating Runs

Runs can be created via the Vern SDK or REST API, as they typically correspond to real-time events or user actions in your application.

### Using the SDK

```typescript
import Vern from "vern";

// Initialize the SDK
const vern = Vern({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Use the explicit runs.create method
const run = await vern.runs.create({
  taskId: "getCarDetails",
  inputs: { registration: "YLG19A" },
});
```

### Using the REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://vern.so/api/v1/runs \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "getCarDetails",
    "inputs": {
      // Input data required by the Task
      "registration": "YLG19A"
    }
  }'
```

**Key Components:**

- `taskId`: **Required.** Specifies which Task definition to execute.
- `inputs`: An object containing the data required by the specified Task. The structure must match the inputs defined when the Task was created in the UI.

## Run ID and Asynchronous Execution

Upon successful submission of a Run creation request, the API immediately returns a response containing a unique **Run ID** (e.g., `run_mno123pqr456`).

**Important:** Vern executes tasks asynchronously. The immediate API response only confirms that the run request was received and queued. It does _not_ mean the task has completed.

The Run ID is used to:

- Check the status of the run (e.g., `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`).
- Retrieve the results or output of the run once it has completed.

## Polling for Run Completion

You can poll for run completion using our SDK:

```typescript
async function pollRunUntilComplete(runId, interval = 10000) {
  while (true) {
    const runDetails = await vern.runs.retrieve(runId);
    if (runDetails.status === "completed") {
      return runDetails;
    }
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, interval));
  }
}

const completedRun = await pollRunUntilComplete(run.id);
// completedRun.result will have the result when done
```

## Example: Running "Find Property Details"

Using the property search example:

- We provide the `taskId` for "Find Property Details".
- We provide the `inputs` (like `address` and `include_photos`) for the property search.

Vern receives this, queues the job, and executes the browser-based task to search for and extract the property details.

## Next Steps

Understanding Runs completes the core workflow: Define browser actions (**Tasks**) and execute them (**Runs**). Explore the API reference for details on managing and monitoring runs.
