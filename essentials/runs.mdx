Runs represent a specific execution instance of a [Task](/essentials/tasks). When you want Vern to perform an action defined by a Task, you create a Run.

## Purpose of Runs

- **Task Execution:** Trigger the actual performance of a defined Task.
- **Input Provision:** Provide the specific data (inputs) required by the Task for this particular execution.
- **Context Specification:** Optionally specify a [Linked Profile](/essentials/profiles) to provide the necessary authentication or configuration context for the execution.
- **Tracking:** Each Run represents a traceable instance of a workflow execution, allowing you to monitor its status and results.

## Creating Runs

Runs are created programmatically via the Vern REST API, as they typically correspond to real-time events or user actions in your application.

To create a Run, you make a `POST` request to the `/v1/runs` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vern.so/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VERN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_id": "tsk_ghi456jkl789",      // ID of the Task to execute
    "profile_id": "prf_xyz789abc123", // Optional: ID of the Profile to use
    "inputs": {
      // Input data required by the Task
      "item_name": "Flux Capacitor",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 150000
    }
  }'
```

**Key Components:**

- `task_id`: **Required.** Specifies which Task definition to execute.
- `profile_id`: **Optional.** Specifies which Linked Profile's credentials/configuration to use. If the task requires authentication or specific settings stored in a profile, this is necessary.
- `inputs`: An object containing the data required by the specified Task. The structure must match the inputs defined when the Task was created in the UI.

## Run ID and Asynchronous Execution

Upon successful submission of a Run creation request, the API immediately returns a response containing a unique **Run ID** (e.g., `run_mno123pqr456`).

**Important:** Vern executes tasks asynchronously. The immediate API response only confirms that the run request was received and queued. It does _not_ mean the task has completed.

The Run ID is used to:

- Check the status of the run (e.g., `pending`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`).
- Retrieve the results or output of the run once it has completed.

You typically need to poll an endpoint like `/v1/runs/{run_id}` or configure webhooks (if available) to be notified of the run's final status and outcome.

## Example: Running "Add Inventory Item"

Using the Boracle ERP example:

- We provide the `task_id` for "Add Inventory Item".
- We provide the `profile_id` for the specific Boracle ERP user (e.g., John Doe) whose credentials should be used.
- We provide the `inputs` (`item_name`, `quantity`, `price`) for the item to be added.

Vern receives this, queues the job, uses the credentials from the specified profile to authenticate with Boracle ERP, and executes the logic defined in the task (calling the `/inventory` endpoint with the provided inputs).

## Next Steps

Understanding Runs completes the core workflow: Define connections (**Integrations**), define actions (**Tasks**), manage context/credentials (**Profiles**), and execute actions (**Runs**). Explore the API reference for details on managing and monitoring runs.
