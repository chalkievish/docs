Integrations are the foundational building blocks in Vern. They represent a secure and configured connection between Vern and an external software application or service (like Salesforce, Slack, Stripe, or your own custom applications).

## Purpose of Integrations

- **Connectivity:** Establish the link between Vern and the target system.
- **Authentication:** Handle the necessary credentials or authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.) required to interact with the external application's API.
- **Scope Definition:** Often define the scope of actions Vern is permitted to perform within the connected application.

## Creating Integrations

Integrations are typically set up manually through the Vern user interface:

1.  Navigate to the **Integrations** section in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/integrations).
2.  Click **"New Integration"**.
3.  Select the application you want to connect from the list of available services or choose to configure a custom integration.
4.  Follow the guided steps to provide necessary authentication details (e.g., API keys, OAuth connection flow) and any specific configuration required by the application.

## Integration ID

Once an Integration is successfully created, Vern assigns it a unique **Integration ID** (e.g., `int_abc123def456`).

This ID is crucial because it's used in the API when:

- Creating [Linked Profiles](/essentials/profiles) associated with this specific integration.
- Sometimes, depending on the setup, identifying the target system when defining [Tasks](/essentials/tasks).

You can find the Integration ID in the details section of the integration within the Vern dashboard.

## Next Steps

Once you have an Integration set up, you can define [Tasks](/essentials/tasks) that Vern can perform using this connection.
