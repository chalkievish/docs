Tasks represent specific, reusable actions or workflows that Vern can perform within a browser. They define _what_ Vern should do when triggered.

## Purpose of Tasks

- **Action Definition:** Encapsulate a specific operation, like "Search for Products", "Fill Out Forms", "Extract Data", or "Complete Checkout".
- **Input Specification:** Define the data (inputs) required to execute the action (e.g., for "Search for Products", inputs might be `query`, `category`, `price_range`).
- **Workflow Logic:** Can range from visiting a single webpage to more complex multi-step browser interactions orchestrated by Vern.
- **Reusability:** Define a task once and trigger it multiple times with different inputs.

## Creating Tasks

Tasks are configured within the Vern user interface:

1.  Navigate to the **Tasks** section in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/tasks).
2.  Click **"New Task"**.
3.  Define the task logic:
    - Specify the websites to visit and the actions to take
    - Map the required input parameters for the task
    - Configure how Vern should interact with elements on the page
    - Define any output mapping or expected results

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    className="shadow-lg"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}

    allowFullScreen={true}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>

## Task ID

Upon creation, Vern assigns the **Task ID** in camel case (e.g., `getCarDetails`) to the task.

This ID is essential as it's the primary identifier used when creating [Runs](/essentials/runs) via the API or SDK. It tells Vern exactly which predefined action to execute.

You can find the Task ID in the details section of the task within the Vern dashboard.

## Example: "Find Property Details" Task

Here's an example of a typical task:

- **Task:** Find Property Details
- **Inputs Defined in UI:** `address` (string), `include_photos` (boolean)
- **Logic Defined in UI:** Navigate to a property website, search for the given address, extract property details and photo URLs.
- **Task ID:** `findPropertyDetails` (example)

## Next Steps

Once you have a Task defined, you can trigger executions of that task by creating [Runs](/essentials/runs) through our API or SDK.
