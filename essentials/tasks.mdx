Tasks represent specific, reusable actions or workflows that Vern can perform within the context of an [Integration](/essentials/integrations). They define _what_ Vern should do when triggered.

## Purpose of Tasks

- **Action Definition:** Encapsulate a specific operation, like "Create User", "Send Message", "Update Record", or "Generate Report".
- **Input Specification:** Define the data (inputs) required to execute the action (e.g., for "Create User", inputs might be `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`).
- **Workflow Logic:** Can range from a single API call to the external application to more complex multi-step workflows orchestrated by Vern.
- **Reusability:** Define a task once and trigger it multiple times with different inputs or [Profiles](/essentials/profiles).

## Creating Tasks

Similar to Integrations, Tasks are typically configured within the Vern user interface:

1.  Navigate to the **Tasks** section in the [Vern Dashboard](https://vern.so/tasks).
2.  Click **"New Task"**.
3.  Select the **Integration** this task will operate on (e.g., the "Boracle ERP" integration).
4.  Define the task logic:
    - Specify the API endpoint(s) in the external application to call.
    - Map the required input parameters for the task.
    - Configure how Vern should handle the request and response (e.g., HTTP method, headers, request body templating).
    - Define any output mapping or expected results.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    className="shadow-lg"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}

    allowFullScreen={false}
    allowTransparency={false}
  />
</div>

## Task ID

Upon creation, Vern assigns a unique **Task ID** (e.g., `tsk_ghi456jkl789`) to the task.

This ID is essential as it's the primary identifier used when creating [Runs](/essentials/runs) via the API. It tells Vern exactly which predefined action to execute.

You can find the Task ID in the details section of the task within the Vern dashboard.

## Example: "Add Inventory Item" Task

Following the Boracle ERP example from the [Quickstart](/quickstart):

- **Integration:** Boracle ERP
- **Task:** Add Inventory Item
- **Inputs Defined in UI:** `item_name` (string), `quantity` (integer), `price` (number)
- **Logic Defined in UI:** Make a `POST` request to Boracle ERP's `/inventory` endpoint, sending the provided inputs in the request body.
- **Task ID:** `tsk_boracle_additem` (example)

## Next Steps

Once you have an Integration and a Task defined, you can trigger executions of that task by creating [Runs](/essentials/runs).
